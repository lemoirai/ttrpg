## Sigil Disappears

**Date:** 237 YFHR

All known portals in the city have also ceased their normal functioning, and instead different portals have begun appearing to replace them. The Planewalker’s Guild steps in as a neutral party to explore and catalogue the new portals for potential resources and information about the city’s predicament, in exchange for consideration with their application to become the fifteenth faction.
