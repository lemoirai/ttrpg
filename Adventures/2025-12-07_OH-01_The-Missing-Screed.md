# Adventure Log: OH-01: The Missing Screed

**Date:** 2025-12-07
**DM:** Leah
**Party:** Malak (Player X), Fennec (Player Y), K'lar (Player Z)
**Original Hook (OH-01):** Who stole the Covenant Screed from the Guvners, and why?

---

## Canonical Event (Result)

The **Covenant Screed** was not stolen, but secretly moved by a splinter faction of the **Harmonium** (The Sons of Harmony) who believed the original location was about to be raided by the **Mercykillers**. The faction leader, **Factol Tethys**, has been operating in secret from a hidden manor on the Plane of Mechanus. The party successfully located the Screed and secured it.

### **New Canonical Event for History: Events:**

> **The Secret Relocation:** In the year before the campaign started, Factol Tethys of the Harmonium splinter faction secretly moved the Covenant Screed to a hidden manor on Mechanus, fearing a raid from the Mercykillers.

## New Open Question/Hook

The party recovered the Screed but learned that the Sons of Harmony's true goal is to *re-write* the Covenant to outlaw all non-Factional activity within Sigil, and their plans for this coup are still active.

### **New Hook Created (OH-02):**

> **OH-02: The Mechanus Manor:** Has Factol Tethys abandoned their plan, or is the manor on Mechanus now a headquarters for an attempted coup of the Harmonium?
