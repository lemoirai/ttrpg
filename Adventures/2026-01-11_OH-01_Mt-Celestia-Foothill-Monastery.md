## **Summary of Excursion**

Following the Guild-assisted "cracking" of the dormant portal, the party exited into a small abandoned town on the shores of Lunia's **Silver Sea**. Shortly after arrival, they met with a local tiefling shepherd, **Flint**, and his sheep (notably a ram named **Bartholomew**). Flint is the last remaining member of the nearby **Order of Planes-Militant** monastery, a site dedicated to **Ilmater**, Toril's God of martyrdom and mercy.

Flint offered information in exchange for the party removing a trio of giant owls from the monastery’s bell tower, which had been preying on his flock. The party also encountered a lantern archon, **Lumen**, who requested the party deal with a group of "bandits" that had destroyed a fellow lantern archon. While Flint insisted the intruders were merely "misguided youths" and noted the monastery had already been stripped of its valuables, Lumen viewed them as a lethal threat.

Upon arrival, the party engaged the owls in the monastery’s bell tower. They dispatched the creatures—leaving the tower structurally intact but combat-scarred—noting that one owl possessed a distinct **shadowy aura**. Proceeding inside, the party identified the "bandits" as acolytes of **Shar**, Toril's goddess of night and secrets. These acolytes utilized the **Shadow Weave** to attack; however, our planeswalkers quickly dispatched them without sustaining any injuries.

**Lumen**, **Flint**, and a hound archon named **Raxia** greeted the party upon their exit. While all three expressed displeasure regarding the lethal force used against the owls and the Sharran "youths," they provided the promised rewards. The party was warned that future visitors from Sigil should expect a significantly increased presence of archons.

## **Important Findings**

- **Portal History:** Flint indicated that the town was a former trade hub connected to Sigil, but the portal had been dormant for over a century.
    
- **Trade Intelligence:** The recovered logbook from the previous Master of the Monastery details several ancient trade routes through Sigil to other Outer Planes. The Guild is currently auditing these routes to see if any remain viable.
    
- **Key Malfunction:** The party recovered a **tuning fork** used by the Order of Planes-Militant. While traditionally used as a key for Lunia-based portals, it currently fails to function; investigation is required to see if it can be re-tuned.
    
- **Shadowfell Influence:** A feather recovered from the "shadowy" owl was confirmed to be tainted with Shadowfell magic. Given the acolytes' worship of Shar (creator of the Shadow Weave), there is a high probability of a Shadowfell rift or portal in the immediate region.

## **Compensation**

- **Guild Payment:** Planewalkers were compensated with **180 gold pieces each** for the recovery of intelligence and the **Periapt of Wound Closure**, which has been added to the guild store.
    
- **On-Site Loot:** The party recovered an additional **55 gold pieces** and several **Symbols of Shar** (steel medallions with dark crystal centers) from the monastery, which were divided among the members.
