## **Canonical Event (Result)**

> **Formal Statement:** Two days after Sigil's portals closed, the party successfully navigated a "cracked" portal to Lunia (Mt. Celestia). They cleared a local monastery of five Shar-worshipping "youths" and three giant owls, retrieving a **Golden Tuning Fork** and a **Journal** belonging to the **Order of the Planes Militant**.

### **The Ripple Effect (Changes to the World)**

* **Physical Changes:** The monastery's bell has been removed. The tower is damaged (top 20ft busted and overgrown with plants, 40ft remains below). A spike trap near the front altar was found deactivated.
* **Faction Relations:**
* **The Archons (- Standing):** Raxia (Hound Archon) and Lumin (Lantern Archon) are unhappy with the party for the "slaughter" of the bandits, whom they viewed as redeemable youths.
* **Order of the Planes Militant:** Interest in the region has been dormant for ~100 years since the portal broke. Relics of the order are now back in Sigil.


* **NPC Status:**
* **Flint:** A Tiefling shepherd with beard and horns; the last of his Order.
* **Bartholomew the Sheep:** Local source of intelligence; hinted that solving the "youths" issue could have yielded favor or 1GP per sheep.
* **Lumin:** Lost a friend (another Lantern Archon) to the Shar monks.


* **Leftovers:** The monastery is now more heavily guarded; the party was warned that **more than two Archons** will be present upon any return.

## **Session Narrative & Detailed Notes**

### **The Briefing (Sigil)**

* **Location:** Started at Niobe’s (Nyouby’s) Cafe, then moved across the street to the **House of Mercy** (Church of Ilmater/mercy-related deities).
* **Context:** Portals closed two days ago without signs. Some are "usable" but hidden.
* **Logistics:** 25 GP base pay to go and return, plus a bonus for intel. The Guild pays a 100 GP ritual cost to "crack" the portal.
* **The Gear:** Players were given bracelets that flash when the portal is about to close, at which point they are "yanked" back.
* **Intel:** The party learned they could potentially learn this portal magic themselves.

### **The Foothills of Lunia**

* **Environment:** A town of ~12 white stone buildings lit in halflight by stars near a large purple sea.
* **Specific Town Buildings:** Blacksmith, Shrine of Ilmater (two hands), Glass blowing shop, Tavern, Whinery, and a Meadery/Brewery.
* **Encounter:** The party spoke to **Bartholomew the sheep**, who saw adventurers heading to the monastery. They followed the sheep up the hill to meet **Flint** (Tiefling).
* **History:** Flint explained the portal has been broken for ~100 years. Since then, the Order’s interest has waned.
* **Preparation:** The party received **300 ft. darkvision** for one hour.

### **The Monastery Raid**

* **The Exterior:** Stone construction. The bell tower has a busted top (~20ft up) with plants growing from the ruins; the tower extends an additional 40ft.
* **Combat:** Three giant carnivorous owls (native to the mountain) attacked. One utilized **darkness (necrotic magic)** and appeared impacted by the Shadow Plane.
* **Interior Investigation:**
* Everything was wrecked: wooden candlesticks and torn tapestries were thrown about.
* **Traps:** Alarm traps were active on windows/doors. A spike trap near the altar was found turned off.
* **Movement:** The party went up the stairs to the left. In the bedroom area, they found footprints of at least two bipedal creatures that passed through recently.


* **The Dining Hall:** The party engaged and defeated **5 youths** (Shar-worshipping spellcaster monks).
