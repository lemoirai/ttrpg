# Focus
* Exploration of new portals to mysterious destinations.
* Base-Building (in Sigil)
* Recurring Villain(s)
* Working for Planewalker’s Guild
* Resurrection Service Available / Go Home (Narrative) Device
* Adventures go to Upper Planes as well as Lower Planes
* Consistent adventure rewards
* Sigil Denizens are bound to the city
* Some portals travel through time.
* This can add new events to the timeline but cannot change the existing canonical events.
* Shared DM repository of resources (e.g. Enemy stat blocks, treasure tables, etc.)
* Everyone starts at 3rd level with starting gear +1 uncommon item.
* At least one post-level 5 adventure w/ a huge dragon.
* Shopping happens out of session (with consistent rules for finding gear)
* Loss of Hall of Records means some missions focus on gathering lost info & records. intel-gathering missions.

# Avoid
* Prime Material Plane (Adventures should take place in the Outer Planes, not Eberron/Toril/etc.)
* Adventures that Railroad the players
* PVP / Intra party combat
* DM Sidekicks or characters (DM characters advance equal to the party in any adventure they run, but are not present on their own adventures).
