# Open Question/Hook: OH-02: The Mechanus Manor
[ example ⚠️ not cannon ]

**Question to be Resolved:** Has Factol Tethys abandoned their plan to re-write the Covenant, or is the manor on Mechanus now a headquarters for an attempted coup of the Harmonium?

**Context/Starting Point:**
* This hook stems from the resolved adventure OH-01, where the party tracked the Covenant Screed to a secret manor on the Plane of Mechanus.
* The manor is assumed to be guarded by Sons of Harmony loyalists.
* Finding the answer requires a party to travel to Mechanus, infiltrate the manor, and discover Tethys's current actions and intentions.

**Potential Adventure Goal:** Infiltrate the manor and retrieve the plans for the "New Covenant" or capture Factol Tethys.
