# Canonical Rules (Structural Mechanics)
[ example ⚠️ not canon ]

These are the established, ratified rules that govern the West Marches campaign structure.

## Adventure & Party Rules
* **Non-Association:** Players in an adventure party do not assume prior knowledge or a relationship with each other, unless explicitly established and agreed upon by the players and DM before the session begins.
* **Level & Gear:** Players begin at Level 3. All official D&D 5e content is permitted (classes, feats, subclasses, etc.).

## Death & Resurrection
* **The Blood Rite:** Before setting out on any adventure, all Player Characters must provide a blood sample to the **Sign of One** faction (who are funding the exploration).
* **Consequence of Death:** If a PC is killed or permanently stranded, the Sign of One uses the blood sample to perform an immediate **resurrection**. The character is returned to Sigil with all memories intact.
* **Equipment Loss:** Upon resurrection, the PC permanently loses all non-attuned equipment, items, and currency they possessed on the adventure.

## Player Motivation & Pay
* **The Patron:** The **Sign of One** faction is funding the bulk of the exploration to prove that Sigil is NOT the center of the Multiverse.
* **Payment:** Players are paid in a combination of high-value planar currency (per session) and "Favors" from the Sign of One, which can be spent on information, supplies, or minor planar transport.
