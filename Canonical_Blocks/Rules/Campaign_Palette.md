# Campaign Palette (Tone & Constraints)
[ example ⚠️ not canon ]

These rules define the desired style and acceptable content for the campaign. DMs must adhere to these constraints when creating adventures.

## Narrative Tone
* **Moral Ambiguity:** Factions and major NPCs are rarely truly "good" or "evil." They operate out of self-interest, conviction, or bizarre planar logic. The campaign should focus on shades of grey.
* **Planar Weirdness:** The multiverse should feel genuinely strange, unpredictable, and often illogical. Emphasize the surreal, impossible geometry, and bizarre laws of physics on outer planes.
* **High-Stakes Exploration:** The focus is on discovery and survival. Combat should be dangerous, and retreat should often be the smartest option.

## Creative Constraints
* **MUST INCLUDE:** Every adventure must involve traversing at least one portal and discovering one unique planar law or property.
* **DMs SHOULD AVOID:** Stories that take place entirely within the Prime Material Plane. The focus is on the Planes.
